# Shopping Cart using React

This is a basic shopping cart which takes in a sample data in JSON format, displays it and enables the user to add items to the cart. To know more about the development process and what I learned in this project, please see this supplementary [blog post](https://rajrajhans.com/shopping-cart-with-react/)

## Running the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
